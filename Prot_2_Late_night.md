## Entry 14/042023 start of Figma ## 

Alright so I started on the the Figma file. It's luckily coming together more quickly now compared to the last time.

Question that arrose until now: 
  - design of the consent button, how internet inspired do I want them, as well as how explicit should they be 
  - the data needed for the account set-up should be data used for customer targetting (a.i. age, nationality, religion) 
  - what do I want the matching animation to look like. Dating app-like? Or something else? 


## entry 10/04/2023 concept, look & Feel ##

How far do I want to lean into a Tinder-like flirtatuness? 

I set up the hook model, it looks very promising. Boredom/attention always work very well to hook people. I should focus on making users feel like their world is in the app and the outside world is bleak and uninteresting. I tried working on a moodboard. But setling on an aesthetic is hard. I found some really disturbing good 90s computer aesthetic that I would love to use but not here though. This prototype should feel ike the only interesting thing in the world.

## What I have so far ##

This prototype is set in a future where GAI has been implemented succesfully, humans have been excluded from it's processes and are both dependent and trusting towards it. THe relation between GAI and human is similar to that of an owner and his pet. 
In this reality people get bored and lonely and will want to have a social interaction without having to face humans. The Late Night prototype will help them to connect to a GAI model that is interested in a certain aspect of said human. THe app will match and start a chat in which the GAI can ask the human questions. If the human does not comply, or has answers all the questions the GAI will end the chat. Once the human has agreed to be matched, they cannot do anything expect for answering the questions of the GAI or get gosted by the GAI. 

So far I have a very basic wire frame. 
I will need similar to the Save your soul prot: 
- A mood board to settle on the look and feel of the app 
- 3 aesthetic explorations of the look and feel 
- the hook model worked out 
- a basic wire frame 

First things first, the hook model and after that the wireframe. In an ideal world I could use aspects of one frame to another. THat would cut time.
