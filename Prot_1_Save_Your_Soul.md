## Starting material ##
This will be the start of the prototype log for Save Your Sould (working title). 
So far I have the following:

This concept is going to be the following: GAI has been succefully implemented into society to the point where it has excluded humans from its workings and is funstion like it's own perfect authority. Humans cannot really interact with the system anymore, but they can offer themselves to the GAI, in hopes that by offering their data, they will be 'saved'.

This is a to do list of what I would need for a prototype. I have looked into the Hook model to make it more fun and I think this current set up would somewhat work and be entertaining. 

I would have to figure out the final look and feel of the prototype, for which I have already made a moodboard:

I am thinking of playing with patterns, combining religious aesthetics with the aesthetics of the internet. To give it an authorative, above-human, exclussive feel. I want to invoke the feeling of a higher power in control of your faith. 

Right now it is important to start actually making a wireframe in Figme, that I can later embellish according to how much time I have.
