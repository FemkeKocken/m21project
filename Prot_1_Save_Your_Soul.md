I have something resembling a Figma wireframe! Huzzah!

I'll present it to max tomorrow. I am also keeping track of a to do list in the Miro.

A feature that I like to explore would be the abstraction of certain actions, creating these customs that turn in rituals. As well as letting the consent button come back again and again to keep the focus on the relation between human and GAI. You are offering yourself to a higher power. You are powerless and will hope for the best outcome. 

My plan is to present this frame to Max, see what he thinks and then start to explore the aesthetics before getting into the assets. I will also have to learn more about adding Figma features such as keyboards, animation and ads.

Started the Figma file. THe plan for now is to first create the complete wireframe and all the screen nessesary. Then fill it in with flourishes and style.

## Starting material ##
This will be the start of the prototype log for Save Your Sould (working title). 
So far I have the following:

This concept is going to be the following: GAI has been succefully implemented into society to the point where it has excluded humans from its workings and is funstion like it's own perfect authority. Humans cannot really interact with the system anymore, but they can offer themselves to the GAI, in hopes that by offering their data, they will be 'saved'.

This is a to do list of what I would need for a prototype. I have looked into the Hook model to make it more fun and I think this current set up would somewhat work and be entertaining. 

I would have to figure out the final look and feel of the prototype, for which I have already made a moodboard:

I am thinking of playing with patterns, combining religious aesthetics with the aesthetics of the internet. To give it an authorative, above-human, exclussive feel. I want to invoke the feeling of a higher power in control of your faith. 

Right now it is important to start actually making a wireframe in Figme, that I can later embellish according to how much time I have.
