Started this journal and Git repo to document the process of my M21 project about identity and chatGPT. I am still very much figuring out how this Github works. 
Process so far: 

“Stimulate Discussion about the Ethical Implications of Emulating another Human using Chatbot Technology”.

Objective #1: Gain and understand why emulating another human being using chatbot technology is ethically problematic.
How? See Sven Nyholm’s book “this is technology ethics” as a starting point.
-lit review on chat bots, ethics, identity and the relation of these three 
Chatbot technology 
What is it, how does it roughly work, what can you do with it
Impersonation of people as a part of chatbot tech
How do you do this online, what do you need for it, how much data do you need
Ethical implications of impersonation 
Breaking laws with copies, ethics, 

-round of experimentations
Training chatbots to see how big the data set has to be 

Ethical implications of impersonation/emulation using chatbot technology
Result: know where the edge is and try to explore this edge case using a prototype

Objective #2: Find a way to emulate another human being in a critical context.
How?  Rilla has a setup you can use.
Create an installation that allows participants to experience these concepts


Objective #3: Investigate the experiences others have interacting with the installation created in O.3.
How? You can use observations, interviews, focus groups, or questionnaires—or a combination of those.

Objective #4: Synthesis and communicate what your learned about other interacting with a chatbot emulating human communication. Refer back to your learnings in Objective #1 to outline were the ethical implications are and why this is problematic.
	How? 
Extra addition: 
I agree that there is a legal angle to this as well—and you can certainly learn about this part as well, but this would require a discussion with a legal professional on this topic. Would be a very nice addition.
Competencies: 
This is very clearly a US centric project. You can show TR depending on how you implement this (multiple options). CA can either be captured in the UI you are using to communicate with the AI (multiple options ranging from physical objects, e.g., a phone, to screen-based interfaces). You can learn about how current language models like GPT-3 are implemented, why they are so powerful, and where their limitations are to show MDC skills.
Anyways. That’s my take on the project. You should phrase it in your own words and create a concrete overview of when you want to work toward which milestone.

Process: 
Documentation GR process with Github for structure 


Next steps: I should get working on a draft planning and lit framework
