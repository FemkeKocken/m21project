## Entry 18/03/2023 ##

Started where I left of yesterday. working out the Synethics. I started with the GAI and reality one. I thought of reality warping designs and what an interesting economy would be utilizing GAI. The idea rolled out remarkably easy. Sell people back their and non-excisting memories. Smart cities and personal data would easily provide enough data and GAI could do the rest in fabricating and mimicking memories. I like the intimacy of Please hold and the phone in general. I also thought about those 17th century shell stilllifes of people showing off exotic (sometimes non-existent shells). Et voilà. I like the disturbing loss of control over something as intimate as your memories, the economic idea behind it and the pun; shelling back your memories.

I then continued with my favourite idea so far, what would humans do all day. Started of by comparison to the horse, an analysis of the function of horses. I like how they embody a connection to nature as well as a historical time capsule. Temporality, recontextualization and natural fallacies some of the few things GAI is not capable of. Though I already kinda knew that. Not sure what to design here... Might revisit this with a clear mind.

I should start a concept development map I think, this might be getting messy soon. No work on the fourth and final analogy yet though. 

## Entry 17/03/2023 ##

I'm still working on the synethics. This is much more work than expected...

I started out with the GAI as Gods idea, did some research on offerings in the 5 biggest religions, made a mood board and then 2 designs. One interesting direction would be to let users offer their data and will dave their soul in return. Certainly a rich design field. 

![M21 interesting bits from lit - analogy 1_ GAI as manmade Gods, what will we offer them_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50365794/225997877-a89961e0-b782-419f-8407-d33df7f00ac1.jpg)

I have some beinings for the other 3 but I just can't squeeze more out of myself today. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50365794/225998086-a6fb9534-0850-47c0-9bc6-4c77395d37c0.png)
these are the other 3 ideas and where I am leaving off for today. 

## Entry 16/03/2023 end of day ##

I was able to do the analogies and metaphors, it took some extra effort to get back into the grove of things. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50365794/225719164-187a07cc-219f-4f5c-a836-c05de43b261b.png)

I find that the four analogies/metaphors all lead to interesting directions 
Reading to the guide I find that the analogies can feed into the synethics, which will safe me some time. I might be able to draw the analogies/sketch them tomorrow as four worlds and gain feedback on these worlds. On Friday in the lab? And then maybe do one extra day of working on the weekend, to get some of this week's tasks done, finish those up early next week and then start making I guess? 

## Entry 16/03/2023 ##

I have succesfully moved into my new apartment, and I took a day off to go to the spa and get my back and my mind straight. It worked. So now it's back to business. Looking at my planning I have the following activities to catch up on from last week: 

- Cultura
- Analogies & Metaphors
- Synethics
- Future Visioning
- Persona

and the following that need to be done this week (narrowing down on a design concept): 

- Define the problem
- Lo-fi making
- Collage
- Storyboard
- Written scenario
- Define a concept
- List of requirements

I found that my story does set an interesting direction to explore; perhaps this research is about exploring the symbiotic(?) relation between natural and artificial intelligence. There are already shard of ideas floating around that topic in my head. Max said he liked the thoughprovoking dystopian feel of the story. Which is a compliment I gladly take. 

For today I think I can set out to do the analogies & metaphors, maybe synethics, and some persona's (based on the story). 

I also feel like this project is hitting differently because of this system as well as the more structured approach of having set out a more reasonable and actionable plan. Where in the past I would get lost more easily in the literature and activities, I feel like I have more of a grip over it. I think this also has to do with the fact that I see the step I have ahead of me, so I now that I need to get there even if it means I have to half-ass the current step. Up until now it feels like I have been half-assing almost every single step. Like this meme: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50365794/225652255-1cb555b3-2c37-402a-abbb-3a2f5624bf6d.png)

But hey, at least I am actually getting things on paper, activities done and I feel like the project has a forward traction. If this project is the half finished horse meme, my previous project would have been an empty sheet. So there, even if it's a shitty horse, at least something is on the paper, and it's not my job to asses the quality of the shitty horse, that's up to my assessors 

I'll continue tomorrow but I think I'll take Sunday off though 

## Lost Entry ##

I think I did not upload one entry... I am missing my less deranged story, which is much better: 

*The Use of a Human*

It was interesting to see how quickly we fell into illiteracy. For most of history, most people were of course illiterate, except for the wealthy. It was precisely that wealth that made most illiterate once again. Major strides were made in the 2000s and onwards, from the first chatbots to the first Large Language Models in the 2020s. It took some 50 years for writing to lose its utility, in the same way horses did after the introduction of the automobile. Since writing was now delegated to the models, it was not particularly hard to reverse the trick and let them read as well. What followed were a couple years of upheaval. The margins of most jobs became much smaller, and most people getting squeezed out of their jobs.
The economy of the 2020s was not ideal to say the least. The Squeeze had already started. The American Dream turned into a feverish haze of freelance contracts, having multiple employers at all times, and changing said employers at least once a year as the pressure was crushing and the competition high. It was the perfect opportunity for Generative Artificial Intelligence to be employed on a large scale. Since the skills required for particular jobs were varied and applicants wanted to send out resumes to as many jobs as possible, why not throw all of your skills, degrees and past experiences in the generative blender and let it compose and send out uniquely fitting resumes to future employers? It would level the playing field to some extent as it was already common knowledge that most resumes won’t be read by human eyes, but by models, scanning for the right keywords. 

That was how language evolved, into keywords. Grammar started to get simplified, and language itself slowly turned into homologized universal blurts of word chunks blurted from human throat to, mostly, machine interfaces. Human contact became rare. As most people did not have the luxury of meeting another human anymore. Centralized workplaces had been phased out as there was simply no need for them as work now mostly consisted of the right input of keywords at the right time as well as the fact the employees were changing companies so quickly now that neither employer nor employee knew exactly who was working for whom. So long as the revenue was going up and wages paid there was no need for panic, right? 

However, is it really that useful having to invest in a workforce that is prone to error, bias, disease and death? Input of the right keywords, at the right time at the right interface is a perfect setup for even low-tier artificial systems. Slowly places of work rose again, but these were now places without physical doors. It was the tower of Babel humming towards the skies, not in language but in code, incompressible to the human ear. To the human eye, they were towers of modems, computers, wires, air conditioning, and not a single coffee machine, all receiving input, calculating, generating output and transferring it as new input. 
The few people that benefitted from this were more often than not those who were able to connect their computational property to their physical likeness. Not their physical body, but more, the human ability to own things. Things like personal names, and more importantly, the bank accounts connected to those names. While these owners were overlooking some beautiful sunset at some exotic end of the world, the only thing that bothered them was that primary existential problem humanity now had to solve once more: What is the use of a human? 



## Entry 07/03/2023 ##

I wrote a very deranged story about a possible future where AI took over: 

After the introduction of GPT and LLMs Artificial Intelligence has rapidly developed from the start of the early 2020. After a brief period of war between Microsoft and Google, Google eventually cutting of their services and infra structure in Australia, killing most of the population. Microsoft eventually took the upper hand by weaponizing their data centre in the former Netherlands and bombing Google’s headquarters in former silicon valley. The remains of what once was Australia has now become Microsoft’s fortified base and the library of all of humanity’s artificial intelligence. No footage even exist of this mysterious data bank and all those who get even close will get all accounts deleted, before getting bombed into oblivion

It was only a matter of time before the governments started to fall. Though it was still surprising to see that it was western Europe that fell first. However, how surprising is it really that a continent that has been functioning as a glorified Instagram museum of war monuments and the misuse of power would become just that. Europe had always been struggling with its grip over its wealth, people and power. Though the real nail in the coffin was the introduction of GovTech. The first step into gaining true intelligence about your population. The poor ministers were too technically illiterate so they delegated all the technical mumbo-jumbo and intimidating heaps of data to intelligence companies, who packaged, sold and resold on the black market, but that just the workings of the free market. It started in around 2020, where algorithms first started to make decisions about who should and should not be checked for welfare fraud, it took a couple years before these systems were put in charge over who should even be receiving welfare, after that the remaining governments decided to throw just one more war before the lights went off. The survivors were added to the pool of digital citizens. Most of them evacuated Europe to Canada, their new status and total submission to the digital society would grant them safe passage. 

During the years of data gather in Europe, the following happened in America: as the tension kept rising between Google and Microsoft, both companies invested heavily into the acquisition of all of the European data. The electric resources for this was so high that the US army was eventually forced to gain resources. First Latin America and then Africa. Making the continents inhabitable for modern humans, but reinstating the natural state of the continent. Only some small villages remain of offline humans. For once, the eco-activists were pleased. The instream of refugees from these former continents was getting too high and the US military was not trained in any other tactic than shooting at everything that moves. Needless to say, global politics got tense after that. 

Asia was trying to enter the race now, gaining funding by improving the European GovTech to the point of complete submission of citizens to the algorithm and sparking the Last European War by provoking toxic nationalism in the citizens through social media. Digital traces of this as well as the algorithmic knowledge that caused these events were later stolen by Middle Eastern spies, and traded to America in exchange to be left alone by the US military. There were no survivors. 
North America dissolved quite peacefully. Since with the right backing from the right companies, anybody could be made president. In an unique collaboration, Microsoft, Google, Meta, ExxonMobil, Coca-Cola and AT&T banded together to put Upsillon, the decedent of Kim Kardashian and Joe Rogan, in office. Upsillon then handed over the nuclear codes to the united front of companies and the states dissolved into the Digital People’s Republic (DPR). With a lack of a governmental body and the threat of gunpoint, Canada joined the new Republic. It was only a matter of time before the data got weaponized and gained privatized armed forces. The winner would take all, and since it was Microsoft who had the most money and data, they won the Last Human War. 

The remaining population on earth is now down to 25 million people. Excluding the Offline, estimated to be 3000 people. Mostly live in the remains of cities on the East and West coast. Citizens of the DPR have enriched their minds with the available knowledge from the 22nd century and have become transhuman. They are now part human and part pure intelligence. Their liveliness safely tucked away in the DPR Databank on Australia.  

Live since then has changed, artificial intelligence has become too complex for any human mind to understand, but there seems to be a symbiotic working between humans and intelligence. Keeping this relationship strong has now become the way of life. Since it’s the intelligence that is in charge of the resources which are distributed among the people. Again, no human mind has been able to comprehend it and going against it has no benefit. Humans and their physical bodies, subject to time and change are the only resources the intelligence cannot stimulate for themselves. It is therefore the two work together. Intelligence provides all resources and humans, the experience of change. 


Though clearly not usable it does contain some interesting seeds. For some reason I did show this to Rilla, she advised me to take the same principles and take them to a less distant and probable future. I will work on that next as well as creating persona's that can live in this world as well as adiscover what potential design may lie in this world. 

## Entry 06/03/23 ##
Today I started working again. I straight up couldn't find the motivation to work on the draft theory, so I have made the decision to leave it for now instead of waisting more days progesting. I have started working on the cultura instead. What I have done is that I have foudn a company culture canvas to give me some inspiration. Source: https://www.fearlessculture.design/blog-posts/the-culture-design-canvas 

I found that this actually helped me in sketching an interesting future, based on Renee's concepts on the ustopia. I would love to explore this further tomorrow, but I have to spend some time and energy on some personal paperwork and the move.

## Entry 02/03/2023 ##

Got some more sleep and feel more human. Note to self: prioritize lower Maslov pyramid layers first, and do not (let anyone) mess with them. 

Wrote down 2 more paragraphs. I aim to have a draft done late Saturday afternoon. Note to self: it's okay if the draft is shitty. 

Had a meeting with Max, he likes the work, make sure I visit the studio and move towards design activities soon. Possibly a design sprint to get things going. Importance on communicating how someone else would experience what I am trying to get across. Make sure to send Max invitations for meeting with Rilla so he can join aswell. 

I'm trying to keep track of the writing process in a seperate file now. We'll see how that goes. 

## Entry 01/03/23 ##

Wrote down 2 paragraphs. wow. No but seriously, I can't really recall a time when I wrote down actully usefull stuff this early in the project. I think the fridge in the office broke. So idk how long I'll be able to camp here. I think today is Wednesday, I should be able to write tomorrow as well, discuss text and the more-than-human idea with Max, and see if I can set something up with Rilla. I might have to adapt the planning a bit as well because I am exhausted and I not nearly done with my slumlord. 

The text: 

Introduction

In 2022 OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM) running on GPT3. Unique about this software was that it can interpret language, therefore doesn’t need keywords, has an enormous data bank to reference and can answer in coherent and informative texts (source: yt video aiwar). ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing app to date. Having surpassed the 100 million mark in January 2023, 14 months after its release (OpenAI source). The model is mostly used as a chatbot, where people ask questions, but it can also write texts, songs, poems, articles and reports that are, for the most part, indistinguishable from human-written text. Models for text generation and image generation have already won from humans in small art contests. (SOURCE). Major stakeholders in the development of LLM and Generative Artificial intelligence (GAI), are OpenAI, Google Deep Mind, Microsoft and Google. In 2023 Microsoft alone invested 10 billion USD in OpenAI alone ( https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html#:~:text=The%20tech%20giant%20aims%20to,with%20its%20partnership%20with%20OpenAI ). Proving to be that GAI is an incredibly powerful tool, developing at an enormous speed. It is yet to be determined what role it will play in everyday life, but there are already some first issues arising regarding integrity, impersonation and the conscience of these, and the use of, these models. 

Explain GAI

GAI is a collective term of AI that is able to generate content output. This output can be in the form of text, video, images and audio. The content itself is generated, or made, by the system and did not exist beforehand. Currently there are multiple popular programs, each specialized in their own output. For example OpenAI DALL-e can generate images based on text input, GPT3 can output coherent text such as songs and poems, Faceapp can edit people into media, also known as deep faking, human voice can be mimicked as well as generated such as vocaloids like Hatsune Miku.utilizing VOCALOID6 ( https://www.vocaloid.com/en/#:~:text=VOCALOID6%20is%20an%20AI%2Dbased,to%20express%20your%20vocal%20ideas.  ).  Diving a bit deeper into GAI with text output, you see a field of competing LLMs, the most popular, likes ChatGPT, Google BARD and Dalton use Natural Language Processing. Meaning that they are able to interpret human input, not relying on keywords. 


## Entry 28/02/2023 ##

After an emmergency move, I am now urban survaviling in an apartment turned office turned makeshift apartment again. Lost some days of work, and a part of my sanity of it, but things seem to have stabilized again. Goals for this week: 

Week 9:
- Write about related works and set up methodology
- What should the reader know about this subject?
- What are we going to do exactly?
- Write related works section

For today I have done some ethical reading. I find that in terms of ethics/design one interesting note is that the current hot debate is that these LLM's and GAI are human/consious but I find that these technologies are in fact MORE than human. In the sense that they seem transhuman or maybe posthuman? They have a different sense of temporarity and memory. It could be interesting to design with that in mind. 

I hope the ethics book will come in, in the meanwhile I could re explore the Whale and the Reactor. Until that time I should spend my time writing out a draft related works and start discussing a plan. This current idea of more-than-human LLMs would fit the objective of the projects. Which is very cool. 

## Entry 24/02/2023 ##

I have the following structure down, but it needs work as well as it should be converted into actual text: 

- Generative AI, what is it 
	- MLM
	- NLP
		- GPT 
		- DALLe
		- Google Bard 
- How does it work 
	- AI 
		- Machine learning 
		- Deep learning 
		- NLP 
- What is unique about it 
	- Major strides in GAI after the publication of the Google paper
	- We now have programs that can interpret language (don’t need keyword based search) 
	- Enormous databank of information 
	- Answers in coherent and informative language 

- The war on AI and the major stakeholders 
	- Microsoft (moves quick but has little users)
		- OpenAI
			- made multiple NLPs
			- Dall-E
				- ChatGPT
	- Google (moves slow but has a large user base) 
		- Google Brain
		- Anthropic
		- Deepmind
			- LamDA (NLP)
				- BARD
	- Goal: to win the zero sum game of getting users, gaining their data, perfect the program and attract more users. 

- Why should I care? 
	- People are weirded out by the fact that ChatGPT and LamDA can express emotions and started questioning their humanity 
	- Data is being used 
	- homonitization of the internet
	- black boxed assistant and non-explained decisions 
	- 
- Why is emulating other humans problematic?
	- People are weired out by expressed emotions of these programs and question their humanity 

- What is technically possible?
	- At the moment GAI is able to pretend it to be something based on information it can find on the web. Since it’s intelligence in based on a human intelligence as well as it’s output format in human speech it will be as if a human is pretending to be something. 	
	- NLP can also express emotions. 
	- Publically available GAI are to some extend censored in not being able to talk about certain topics, gets confused about lying, and will make certain option unavailable after certain trigger words. 
	- Downside is that it is trained on human data with biases 
	- Downside is that it online models can start eating their own shit by training on their own data output 
	- Create personalized responses 

- What can be done within the span of this research and my skills?
	- It is possible to make Discord bots 
	- Prototype of the therapist 
	- Design fictions 
	
- WWWWH
	- Who? Google, Microsoft, their companies, their products 
	- What? GAI
	- Why? Data, hominization, unexplained black box decision making, the question of humanity 
	- When? In the next 5 years the first systems will come out in the next ten they should be adapted I think  
	- How? Gaining users quickly, using their data to perfect the system, optimize the product, gain more users (flywheel) 

Ohter than that, I am dealing with hosuing issues again. Next week will probably be couchsurfing. I hope I can keep productivity up. 

## Entry 23/02/23 ##

Slightly less project productive day. I have a lot going on with the move and such. 
Did explore some more non-academic sources that do start to float around the why question. 
The first people are weirded out by the emotions that it is displaying, and I myself, am wondering about what a weird blend GAI is between human intelligence and the timeless, limitless void of data that the web has become. NLP and GAI, are not human. They are more than human in my personal opinion. 

I was also thinking of making a video parody of the silicon girl tech bosses promoting matches with GAI, taking all your data , using all data available to create the perfect user experience. Would definitly be fun to play the unnerving proffesional girlboss tech CEO

I'll have to start writing some things down tomorrow and update for next week. 

## Entry 22/02/23 ##

Have not started on the paragraphs just yet. However I am reading into the AI war and I think I can now describe the Who and the What questions: 
- What? 
	- Generative artificial Intelligence 
		- text
			- ChatGPT
				- Runs on GPT-3 
			- Google BARD 
		- photo
			- Dall-E
		- video 
			- Deep fakes 
			-
		- speech 
			- text to speech and vice versa 
- Who?
	 - Microsoft 
	 	- OpenAI
			- made multiple NLPs
				- Dall-E
				- ChatGPT
	 - Google
		- Google Brain
		- Anthropic
		- Deepmind 
			- LamDA (NLP)
				- BARD
				
- Why? 
	- War on AI. Google's first real threat in 20 years, will probably revolutionize the way search engines are being used. From a monetary standpoint this is interesting because technologies like these are a zero sum game, a flywheel that gets set in motion by gaing users, gaining their data, optimizing and gaining more. Microsoft is rushing to get as many users onboard through implementing ChatGPT into Bing, dethroning Google's Chrome. However the technology is capable of much much more. This is going to be an enty into the ethics I think. 

I think I need to iron out further how the components come together, but I think it sketches a picture. 
	
## Entry 21/02/23 ##

Meeting with Max, if your readin this, hi Max!

As an extra goal for this week I want to write 1 or 2 paragraphs about the classification and basic workings of GAI and ChatGPT. I have planned this for tomorrow when I'm sharp. 
When the book is in, I will have to make work of the ethical framework as t not get lost in interesting philosophy related plotholes. 
For this framework I will have to describe the ethical framework and what are interesting bits in there. 

For today I have done some more general lit review, and dove into Data foundry (https://df-staging.id.tue.nl/)

## Entry 20/02/23 ##

I have found some initial papers and worked my way through them. So far I am learning:
- how chatgpt classifies 
- what the important words are 
- some basics on how the program works 
- pros and cons. 

I keep think about Slavoj Žižek on Synthetic Sex and "Being Yourself". (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xYO-VMZUGo&ab_channel=BigThink)

i am orgnizing my thoughts in the following Miro board: Miro board (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlPDJHE=/)

There is one paper I didn't get to yet, as well as that I want to look into FB enforcing against manipulated media, Stable diffusion and more Zizek

### edit: yo what if I would let DALLe and chatGPT run my instragram absed on the best Instagram strategy for shits and giggles? Could be a fun side project ##
## Entry 20/02/23 ##

I kinda crashed and burned after a classical episode of wanting too much and pushing it too far. This week is supposedly literature week. By the end of this week I will have supposed to have:

 - create clusters 
 - answers the following: 
	- Why is emulating other humans problematic? 
	- What is technically possible? 
	- What can be done within the span of this research and my skills? 
	- WWWWH
  - Write draft of related works section 

So far I have explored some non-acadmic sources on Chatgpt and find that useful terms are openAI and language models. I found a tutorials as how to train models and create discord bots as well by **Adrian Twarog**

Markup is going better. 

End goal of today: find academic sources. parameters are: papers on chatgpt, identity theft, chatgpt and legal issues, language models and identity, general info on language models, info on building/training models. 

## Entry 15/02/23 ##

Restarting this Journal after some help of Shrahrom. Thanks Shrahrom. 
I have discussed my plan to do a project on copying people with Max and Rilla, who seemm to be on board. Max helped me in setting out objectives and goals which I have turned into a planning and goals. 

### Objectives
**“Stimulate Discussion about the Ethical Implications of Emulating another Human using Chatbot Technology”.**

**Objective #1: Gain and understand why emulating another human being using chatbot technology is ethically problematic.**
How? lit review on chat bots, ethics, identity and the relation of these three 
Chatbot technology 
-What is it, how does it roughly work, and what can you do with it
-Impersonation of people as a part of chatbot tech
-How do you do this online, what do you need for it, how much data do you need
-Ethical implications of impersonation 
-Breaking laws with copies, ethics, 

Result: know where the edge is and try to explore this edge case using a prototype

**Objective #2: Find a way to emulate another human being in a critical context.**
How?  8 weeks of designing prototypes. Double diamond. Moving from exploring the design space, to narrowing down further to a concept. Exploring the concept space, narrowing down on a concept and building the final prototype 
Result: an experienceable prototype that can be used to spark discussion and make the concept tangible. 

**Objective #3: Investigate the experiences others have interacting with the installation created in O.3.**
How? observations, interviews, focus groups, or questionnaires, dairy study? Will be further defined at the end of the research phase. 

**Objective #4: Synthesis and communicate what your learned about other interacting with a chatbot emulating human communication. Refer back to your learnings in Objective #1 to outline were the ethical implications are and why this is problematic.**
	How? Write the report that goes with this project. 

**Extra addition:**
Potentially explore the legal implications of all of this. 
	How? Present this protype and/or findings to legal experts (which continent?)
