## Entry 24/02/2023 ##

I have the following structure down, but it needs work as well as it should be converted into actual text: 

- Generative AI, what is it 
	- MLM
	- NLP
		- GPT 
		- DALLe
		- Google Bard 
- How does it work 
	- AI 
		- Machine learning 
		- Deep learning 
		- NLP 
- What is unique about it 
	- Major strides in GAI after the publication of the Google paper
	- We now have programs that can interpret language (don’t need keyword based search) 
	- Enormous databank of information 
	- Answers in coherent and informative language 

- The war on AI and the major stakeholders 
	- Microsoft (moves quick but has little users)
		- OpenAI
			- made multiple NLPs
			- Dall-E
				- ChatGPT
	- Google (moves slow but has a large user base) 
		- Google Brain
		- Anthropic
		- Deepmind
			- LamDA (NLP)
				- BARD
	- Goal: to win the zero sum game of getting users, gaining their data, perfect the program and attract more users. 

- Why should I care? 
	- People are weirded out by the fact that ChatGPT and LamDA can express emotions and started questioning their humanity 
	- Data is being used 
	- homonitization of the internet
	- black boxed assistant and non-explained decisions 
	- 
- Why is emulating other humans problematic?
	- People are weired out by expressed emotions of these programs and question their humanity 

- What is technically possible?
	- At the moment GAI is able to pretend it to be something based on information it can find on the web. Since it’s intelligence in based on a human intelligence as well as it’s output format in human speech it will be as if a human is pretending to be something. 	
	- NLP can also express emotions. 
	- Publically available GAI are to some extend censored in not being able to talk about certain topics, gets confused about lying, and will make certain option unavailable after certain trigger words. 
	- Downside is that it is trained on human data with biases 
	- Downside is that it online models can start eating their own shit by training on their own data output 
	- Create personalized responses 

- What can be done within the span of this research and my skills?
	- It is possible to make Discord bots 
	- Prototype of the therapist 
	- Design fictions 
	
- WWWWH
	- Who? Google, Microsoft, their companies, their products 
	- What? GAI
	- Why? Data, hominization, unexplained black box decision making, the question of humanity 
	- When? In the next 5 years the first systems will come out in the next ten they should be adapted I think  
	- How? Gaining users quickly, using their data to perfect the system, optimize the product, gain more users (flywheel) 

Ohter than that, I am dealing with hosuing issues again. Next week will probably be couchsurfing. I hope I can keep productivity up. 

## Entry 23/02/23 ##

Slightly less project productive day. I have a lot going on with the move and such. 
Did explore some more non-academic sources that do start to float around the why question. 
The first people are weirded out by the emotions that it is displaying, and I myself, am wondering about what a weird blend GAI is between human intelligence and the timeless, limitless void of data that the web has become. NLP and GAI, are not human. They are more than human in my personal opinion. 

I was also thinking of making a video parody of the silicon girl tech bosses promoting matches with GAI, taking all your data , using all data available to create the perfect user experience. Would definitly be fun to play the unnerving proffesional girlboss tech CEO

I'll have to start writing some things down tomorrow and update for next week. 

## Entry 22/02/23 ##

Have not started on the paragraphs just yet. However I am reading into the AI war and I think I can now describe the Who and the What questions: 
- What? 
	- Generative artificial Intelligence 
		- text
			- ChatGPT
				- Runs on GPT-3 
			- Google BARD 
		- photo
			- Dall-E
		- video 
			- Deep fakes 
			-
		- speech 
			- text to speech and vice versa 
- Who?
	 - Microsoft 
	 	- OpenAI
			- made multiple NLPs
				- Dall-E
				- ChatGPT
	 - Google
		- Google Brain
		- Anthropic
		- Deepmind 
			- LamDA (NLP)
				- BARD
				
- Why? 
	- War on AI. Google's first real threat in 20 years, will probably revolutionize the way search engines are being used. From a monetary standpoint this is interesting because technologies like these are a zero sum game, a flywheel that gets set in motion by gaing users, gaining their data, optimizing and gaining more. Microsoft is rushing to get as many users onboard through implementing ChatGPT into Bing, dethroning Google's Chrome. However the technology is capable of much much more. This is going to be an enty into the ethics I think. 

I think I need to iron out further how the components come together, but I think it sketches a picture. 
	
## Entry 21/02/23 ##

Meeting with Max, if your readin this, hi Max!

As an extra goal for this week I want to write 1 or 2 paragraphs about the classification and basic workings of GAI and ChatGPT. I have planned this for tomorrow when I'm sharp. 
When the book is in, I will have to make work of the ethical framework as t not get lost in interesting philosophy related plotholes. 
For this framework I will have to describe the ethical framework and what are interesting bits in there. 

For today I have done some more general lit review, and dove into Data foundry (https://df-staging.id.tue.nl/)

## Entry 20/02/23 ##

I have found some initial papers and worked my way through them. So far I am learning:
- how chatgpt classifies 
- what the important words are 
- some basics on how the program works 
- pros and cons. 

I keep think about Slavoj Žižek on Synthetic Sex and "Being Yourself". (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xYO-VMZUGo&ab_channel=BigThink)

i am orgnizing my thoughts in the following Miro board: Miro board (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlPDJHE=/)

There is one paper I didn't get to yet, as well as that I want to look into FB enforcing against manipulated media, Stable diffusion and more Zizek

### edit: yo what if I would let DALLe and chatGPT run my instragram absed on the best Instagram strategy for shits and giggles? Could be a fun side project ##
## Entry 20/02/23 ##

I kinda crashed and burned after a classical episode of wanting too much and pushing it too far. This week is supposedly literature week. By the end of this week I will have supposed to have:

 - create clusters 
 - answers the following: 
	- Why is emulating other humans problematic? 
	- What is technically possible? 
	- What can be done within the span of this research and my skills? 
	- WWWWH
  - Write draft of related works section 

So far I have explored some non-acadmic sources on Chatgpt and find that useful terms are openAI and language models. I found a tutorials as how to train models and create discord bots as well by **Adrian Twarog**

Markup is going better. 

End goal of today: find academic sources. parameters are: papers on chatgpt, identity theft, chatgpt and legal issues, language models and identity, general info on language models, info on building/training models. 

## Entry 15/02/23 ##

Restarting this Journal after some help of Shrahrom. Thanks Shrahrom. 
I have discussed my plan to do a project on copying people with Max and Rilla, who seemm to be on board. Max helped me in setting out objectives and goals which I have turned into a planning and goals. 

### Objectives
**“Stimulate Discussion about the Ethical Implications of Emulating another Human using Chatbot Technology”.**

**Objective #1: Gain and understand why emulating another human being using chatbot technology is ethically problematic.**
How? lit review on chat bots, ethics, identity and the relation of these three 
Chatbot technology 
-What is it, how does it roughly work, and what can you do with it
-Impersonation of people as a part of chatbot tech
-How do you do this online, what do you need for it, how much data do you need
-Ethical implications of impersonation 
-Breaking laws with copies, ethics, 

Result: know where the edge is and try to explore this edge case using a prototype

**Objective #2: Find a way to emulate another human being in a critical context.**
How?  8 weeks of designing prototypes. Double diamond. Moving from exploring the design space, to narrowing down further to a concept. Exploring the concept space, narrowing down on a concept and building the final prototype 
Result: an experienceable prototype that can be used to spark discussion and make the concept tangible. 

**Objective #3: Investigate the experiences others have interacting with the installation created in O.3.**
How? observations, interviews, focus groups, or questionnaires, dairy study? Will be further defined at the end of the research phase. 

**Objective #4: Synthesis and communicate what your learned about other interacting with a chatbot emulating human communication. Refer back to your learnings in Objective #1 to outline were the ethical implications are and why this is problematic.**
	How? Write the report that goes with this project. 

**Extra addition:**
Potentially explore the legal implications of all of this. 
	How? Present this protype and/or findings to legal experts (which continent?)
