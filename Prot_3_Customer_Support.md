So far, I have a Hook model and a working concept of trying to reach customer support while reality is glitching out. THis is based on the low trust, high inclussivity relationship. It is about communicating a reality wherein GAI is semi-succesfully implemented, as augmented reality. It is not clear what is real and what is fake anymore. 

I am currently working on the no-fi wireframe. THe concept should centre on sparking discussion on GAI and reality I suppose. I want to do this by providing a mystery of: what happened to the world, through an increasingly glitchy app. The participant will get bits and pieces as to why reality is glitching. 

Maybe because you are getting hacked? 

### Could be a good scary concept. Somebody hacking into your reality. Give me your money, or I'll end your 'life as you know it' ###

### What does getting hacked look like? ###

This no fi board helped in designing the experience of Customer Support. I think this should be about getting hacked/digitally robbed. It should feel a bit thriller like
